Simple Calculator in C

Introduction

This project is a **Simple Calculator written in C** that performs arithmetic, relational, and logical operations.
It’s designed as a beginner-friendly program to help understand basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, operators, and user input handling.


Features

* Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Supports relational operations: less than, greater than, equal to
* Includes logical operations: AND, OR, NOT
* Provides input validation for safe calculations
* Simple menu-driven interface for easy use


How It Works

The program displays a list of available operations and prompts the user to select one.
Based on the user’s choice, it requests the required number of inputs, performs the calculation using conditional and switch-case logic, and then displays the result.


How to Run

1. Save the file as `calculator.c`.
2. Open a terminal or code editor and compile the program using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable to start the calculator.
4. Follow the on-screen menu to perform operations.
